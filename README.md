# HTML and CSS Projects

**by Leonardo Cavalcante Araujo**

<br>

## Introduction
This repository contains different projects that I have realized while studying HTML and CSS, during some online courses and also during my bootcamp at **Humind School**.

*PS.: Only the final projects were stored here, and not the beginner or intermediate exercises.*

<br>

## Courses
I have had the opportunity to develop my skills HTML and CSS during 3 different courses:
- **Humind School**: the 1st Sales and Business Development school in France. I have participated in its bootcamp from September 2020 to October 2020.
- **Code Institute**: offered a free course called **5-Day Coding Challenge**, receiving an online certificate.
- **FreeCodeCamp** online course with practical exercises of HTML and CSS.

<br>

## Results/Outcome of each course
- **Humind School - Annuaire des Startups**: website with a table of different French startups that interests me.
- **Code Institute**: HTML+CSS webpage with a recipe for making Tea.
- **FreeCodeCamp project**: HTML webpage to upload cat photos and a CSS file for creating the image of a penguin.
